 # Coronavirus Prevention System :space_invader:
 
## This project seeks to provide a solution by leveraging Artificial Intelligence :desktop_computer: to scan the area for both people wearing and not wearing masks, providing a mask to those not wearing one, and logging events for statistical tracking purposes.

### :heavy_check_mark:Our Motivation

:bangbang: COVID- 19 has been spreading quickly since November 2019. More than 400,000 people have lost their lives

‼️ WHO and public health officials recommend wearing mask and social distancing of 6-feet or more to reduce the risk of transmission

‼️ We wanted to build a low cost and effective robot that uses machine learning to detect faces of people without masks. Automatically open its storage compartments for non-mask wearing person to get a face mask 


### :heavy_check_mark:Our Objectives
‼️ Aims to provide a cost-effective and easy to use system to distribute single-use masks 

‼️ Rely on simple tried-and-true components and designs

‼️ Two main functions: Detection & Data collection. By gathering user data, we will be able to prepare user statistics on health and behaviors


### :heavy_check_mark:Our System Overview
**LAMP Stack**
- Linux (The Operating System)
- <s>Apache (The Web Server)</s> We hosted the data locally so we did not use Apache! 
- MySQL (The Database)
- Python (The Programming Language)

### :heavy_check_mark:Our Database System
- Person_id (int) : auto_increment 
- Mask (boolean type)
- Date_time (datetime type)

### :heavy_check_mark:Our GUI Application
- Used Python GUI framework Tkinter which is fast and easy to make funtional GUI within 2 months
- This is User-friendly App for different purposes:
  - Show databses
  - Display data based on different date
  - Can be used for analytical purposes in the future!
